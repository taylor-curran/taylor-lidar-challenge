# 3D Visualization & Command

**Brief:**  
Develop a program and GUI to visualize and command multiple vehicles in a 3D environment and update a terrain map based on their sensor measurements.

---

## Objective
The goal of this challenge is to develop a real-time GUI application that visualizes a 3D scene using LiDAR data streams from five autonomous "rovers." These rovers would be construction machines such as excavators, bulldozers, and roller-compactors. The application should provide both a dynamic visualization of the environment and a control interface for interacting with the rovers.

---

## Core Feature Requirements

### 1. 3D Visualization of Rover & LiDAR Data
- The application should render and update the environment in real-time using the data streams available from the 5 rovers.  
- Each rover's position and orientation should be represented visually.  
- The visualization should update dynamically as new LiDAR data arrives.  
- The terrain should be mapped and updated from incoming LiDAR points as the rovers explore. The result should be a persistent surface of where the rovers covered.  

### 2. Camera & Scene Navigation
- The user should be able to freely reposition the camera in the scene to inspect different parts of the environment.  
- There should be an easy way to focus on specific rovers and follow their movements.  

### 3. Rover Control & Status Interface
- The application should provide an interface to select and monitor a rover.  
- The interface should display:  
  - The rover’s current position and orientation.  
  - The status of its command buttons (4 total, on/off).  
- Users should be able to send commands to control a rover's buttons **0 through 3**.  
- Seamless switching between rovers should be supported.  

### 4. Performance & Usability
- The solution must run with minimal latency, **sub 50ms end-to-end**.  
- The application should run on a Linux system and be as lightweight as possible, not requiring overly specialized hardware (sample computer: Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 3 running Ubuntu 22.04).  
- The UI should be intuitive for users to switch between viewing rovers and issuing commands.  

---

## Data Exchange
- All data exchange should occur via **UDP on localhost**.

## Challenge Summary
This challenge tests your ability to build a real-time, interactive 3D visualization system, efficiently process incoming data, and design an intuitive GUI for controlling autonomous vehicles.  

- Code for emulating the rovers, along with a detailed README, is included in the attached zip file.  
- You may use any resources of your choosing (including textbooks, internet, AI tools, etc.); however, you may **not share the problem statement or materials with others**.  
- Send source code with compilation instructions that can run on a Linux system. You may also optionally include an executable or playable demo in any format.
